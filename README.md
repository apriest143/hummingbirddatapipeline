Building out a data cleaning pipeline for Hummingbird Ventures

This project seeks to create a streamlined and automated way of implementing changes to the
hummingbird ventures dataset.

Data from outside sources goes into /data
- only update these files!!!

I will try and make a comprehensive overview of which .py files to run and in which order. This may be messy for a time but as I go it should get more clear.



Here is the NCES-IPEDS batch Data session information for replicatability:
